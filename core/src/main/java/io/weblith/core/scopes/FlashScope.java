/**
 * Flash Scope consists of two kinds of data: "current" and "outgoing". Current data will only exist for the current
 * request. Outgoing data will exist for the current and next request. Neither should be considered secure or encrypted.
 * Its useful for communicating error messages or form submission results.
 * 
 * A FlashScope is i18n aware and the values will be looked up for i18n translations by template engines that support
 * it.
 * 
 * If the Flash Scope has outgoing data then a cookie will be sent to the client and will be valid on the next request.
 * Stuff in a flash cookie gets deleted after the next request.
 * 
 * If an incoming request has a flash cookie then the data from it will be loaded as "current" flash data. Unless you
 * keep() those keys that data will only be valid for the current request.
